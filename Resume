Surrogate-Based Optimization

    Design of experiments
        - classic
            full-factorial design
            central composite design (CCD)
            Box-Behnken
            D-Optimal Design (DOD)
        - modern
            Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
            Orthogonal Array Design (OAD)
            Uniform Design (UD)

        An overview of the classic and modern DoE methods was presented by Giunta et al. (2001)

    Surrogate models
        RSM (polynomial Response Surface Model)
        Kriging
        RBFs (Radial Basis Functions)
            - Decaying functions:
                Gaussian (GAUSS)
                Hardy's Inverse Multiquadric (HIMQ)
            - Growing functions:
                Power function (POW)
                Thin Plate Spline (TPS)
                Hardy's Multiquadric (HMQ)
        Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  (Elanayar et al. 1994, Park et al. 1991)
                Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
                Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Smola & Schoelkopf 2004)

    The readers are referred to read the paper by Wang & Shan (2007) and the books written by Keane et al. (2005) and by Forrester et al. (2008) for more description about surrogate modeling techniques
